        <h4>Why a strategic plan?</h4>
        
        <p>
          In 1968 a small group of paediatricians came together to share resources and information in an age where new children’s diseases were emerging. They were faced with a large, and increasing population, scarcity of resources, research and solutions to face these problems. It Is on this common ground that the Paediatric Association was formed. 


        </p>
        <p>
          Fast forward to 2014 the reason to have the association haven’t changed. We still need paediatricians, researchers, practitioners and other interested parties to share information and research to ensure that our children receive the right treatment. However, the landscape has changed vastly since 1968. There have been huge leaps forward in both knowledge and technology  and thus the association must constantly reassess and restructure to keep with the times. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In our assessment we identified the following seven issues:
        </p>
        <ul style="list-style:none;">
          <li>
           <strong>Issue 1:</strong> The institutional capacity is below the required threshold
          </li>
         <li> <strong> Issue 2:</strong> Recruitment, retention and engagement of members in the association is lower than it should be</li>
<li> <strong>Issue 3:</strong> Inadequate engagement in national child health policy planning, development and dissemination</li>
<li> <strong>Issue 4:</strong> Members are not utilising ICT-based knowledge and learning resources to full capacity</li>
<li> <strong>Issue 5:</strong> Inadequate research on child health conducted by KPA members</li>
<li> <strong>Issue 6:</strong> Lack of a clear partnership and collaboration policy framework</li>
<li> <strong>Issue 7:</strong> Standards of quality for paediatric training and professional education are lower than expected</li>

         
        </ul>
        <p>
          In order to handle this our strategic plan, available for download below, comprehensively covers the six steps below:
        </p>
        <ul style="list-style:none;">
          <li>
            <strong>Step 1:</strong> Carry out organisational assessments and develop operational plans for action</li>
<li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Mobilise, recruit, engage and motivate members and affiliated paediatric healthcare professionals</li>
<li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Proactive engagement with government and stakeholders to influence and develop child health policies</li>
<li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Enhance the research capacity of KPA members</li>
<li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Develop a partnership and collaboration policy framework</li>
<li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Establish a professional Kenyan College of Paediatrics</li>
