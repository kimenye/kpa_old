  <h4>The Kenya Emergency triage Assessment and Treatment PLUS Admission Care Course (ETAT +)</h4>
  
    <p>
      ETAT+ is a 5 day course expanding the scope of the WHO's original ETAT course resulting from a collaboration with the Ministry of Health in Kenya. It is aimed at all health workers providing initial care in a typical African hospital setting and offers training in the following areas:
<ul>
<li>Outpatient triage for sick young infants and children.</li>
<li>Emergency care including technologically appropriate life support for infants, children and the newborn.</li>
<li>Immediate and admission care for children with hypoglycaemia, convulsions, dehydration and shock, malaria, severe anaemia, meningitis, pneumonia, severe malnutrition, neonatal sepsis and care of the preterm infant.</li>
<li>The course aims to provide training in line with international best practice and uses well established teaching methods employed by the European Resuscitation Council. This includes end of course theory and practical examinations. To date pass rates have exceeded 80%.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The course was developed in 2006 by the KEMRI / Welcome Trust Research Programme in collaboration with the Division of Child Health in the Kenyan Ministry of Health and the University of Nairobi. The Ministry of Health has supported courses in Provincial Hospitals and the course has received support from The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (UK) and WHO. At present Kenya Paediatric Association is taking on an increasingly important role in supporting training in government hospitals as the Department of Paediatrics supports training in the University of Nairobi. Thus the Kenya Paediatric Association has recently become the administrative home for the course and with the support of the KEMRI / Wellcome Trust Programme and the Ministry of Health will we hope conduct at least 3 further courses in 2009 in government facilities.
</p>
<p>
In addition to the more than 680 formally trained in November 2007 and 2008 a 580 medical officer, interns awaiting posting received a 1 day introduction to ETAT+. Since the start of 2008, all undergraduate medical students have also received a tailor made 3-day version of the ETAT+ course, resulting in training of 400 medical students at the University of Nairobi to date.
</p>
<p>
Finally in January 2009 19 new ETAT+ Instructors went through the UK Resuscitation Council's Generic Instructor Course in a collaboration with Aga Khan Hospital. We thank all those who have contributed to this effort and to scaling-up the training of ETAT+ in Kenya. To date the number of medical personnel trained nears 700.

    <p>The goal of this project is to strengthen a Kenyan network of Paediatricians and other affiliated health workers both in government and the private sector to support the rapid expansion of paediatric HIV care, including antiretroviral therapy.
</p>
<p>
This project has the vision of building and sustaining the capacity of clinicians and other health workers in the provision of paediatric HIV care in addition to participating in paediatric HIV related policy issues in collaboration with the Ministry of Health.
</p>
<p>
Project Objectives
<ul>
<li>
To train Kenyan health workers in management of Paediatric HIV- through institution
based training, workshops and symposiums. The project also develops trainers on comprehensive Paediatric HIV care including psychosocial care providers.
</li>
<li>
To support all ART providers with regular supervisory visits (downstream mentorship) and clinical attachments at established comprehensive care facilities (institutional mentorship).
</li>
<li>
To maintain a resource base at the KPA head-office linking it with the provincial centers for HIV specialist consultation and educational updates.
Maintain national leadership role in Paediatric HIV issues at the National AIDS/STI Control Program (NASCOP) level.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

    <p>Project Objectives
<ul>
<li>
Development of a consensus statement on a rational approach to new and emerging childhood immunisations including simple summaries of risks, benefits and the local burden of different diseases (for example meningitis, pneumonia and hepatitis A) and explanation of the additional burden in three high risk groups: children with sickle cell disease, HIV infection and very low birth weight / premature infants.
</li>
<li>
Dissemination of the consensus statement and promotion of discussion at professional meetings and educational fora.
</li>
<li>
Engagement with non-professional, civil society groups, including those representing high risk children, to present and explain key issues including; burden of disease, risk, vaccination effectiveness, the benefits of prevention, and cost that underlie vaccine choices.
</li>
<li>
To explore the current views of Paediatricians, as opinion leaders, on the value of new and emerging vaccines for children and whether these views change in response to the provision of locally appropriate credible information.
</li>
